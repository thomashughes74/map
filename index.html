    Stop-and-frisk and other discriminatory policing policies led to a disproportionate arrest record for marijuana charges in New York City for decades, according to a 2018 report by Comptroller Scott Stringer. As reported by the NYPD, most arrests have continued in precints outside of Manhattan.</p>
<p>
    </p>
    <p>According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, "Cannabis use is not allowed in motor vehicles (even if they are parked) or in outdoor dining areas at restaurants. Smoking or vaping cannabis in prohibited areas may result in a summons and fine. It is still against the law for people younger than 21 years old to possess, sell or use any amount of cannabis. Also, no one may legally possess more than three ounces of cannabis, sell any amount without a license or drive while under the influence or impaired by cannabis."</p>
    <p>
        The arrests also fell along racial lines, with Black and Latinos making up 100% of arrests in the 3rd quarter of this year. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, which advocated for legalization, "Black New Yorkers bear the brunt of these arrests despite government research that shows that white people use marijuana at higher rates than black people do."
